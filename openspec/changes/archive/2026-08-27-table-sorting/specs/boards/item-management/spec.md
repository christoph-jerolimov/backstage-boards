## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Table sorting
The table view SHALL allow sorting by the Title, Status, Created by, and Updated columns via their headers, toggling between ascending and descending. Sorting SHALL combine with active filters, and with group-by-assignee enabled it SHALL order the items within each group.

#### Scenario: Sort by title
- **WHEN** a user activates the Title header
- **THEN** rows order alphabetically by title, and activating it again reverses the order

#### Scenario: Sorting within groups
- **WHEN** group-by-assignee is active and a sort is applied
- **THEN** each assignee group's rows are ordered by the selected sort
